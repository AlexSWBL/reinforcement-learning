# ðŸ§  Reinforcement Learning Agents â€“ CS 188 Project

This repository contains reinforcement learning agents implemented in Python to solve dynamic environments such as **Gridworld** and **Pacman**, as part of UC Berkeleyâ€™s CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… **Value Iteration Agent** for solving known MDPs using dynamic programming  
- âœ… **Q-Learning Agent** for model-free learning through environment interaction  
- âœ… **Approximate Q-Learning Agent** with function approximation for scalability  
- ðŸŽ® Supports **Pacman** and **Gridworld** environments  
- ðŸ§ª Includes testing scripts via `autograder.py` for quick evaluation
