# Reinforcement Learning Agents â€“ CS 188 Project

This project implements several reinforcement learning agents to solve dynamic environments such as Gridworld and Pacman. The algorithms include **Value Iteration**, **Q-Learning**, and **Approximate Q-Learning**. This project is based on UC Berkeleyâ€™s CS 188 framework.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Solves Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) using Value Iteration  
- Implements Q-learning with exploration strategies  
- Scales to high-dimensional states using linear feature-based approximation  
- Includes testing and visualization in **Pacman** and **Gridworld**
